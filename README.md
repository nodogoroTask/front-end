## Project setup

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```



### Configure credentials

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 domain and client ID in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy `src/auth_config.json.example` into a new file in the same folder called `src/auth_config.json`, and replace the values with your own Auth0 application credentials, and optionally the base URLs of your application and API:

```json
{
  "domain": "{YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN}",
  "clientId": "{YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID}",
  "audience": "{YOUR AUTH0 API_IDENTIFIER}",
  "appOrigin": "{OPTIONAL: THE BASE URL OF YOUR APPLICATION (default: http://localhost:3000)}",
  "apiOrigin": "{OPTIONAL: THE BASE URL OF YOUR API (default: http://localhost:3001)}"
}
```

**Note**: Do not specify a value for `audience` here if you do not wish to use the API part of the sample.

## Run the sample

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the React app and starts the backend API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker build

To build and run the Docker image, run `exec.sh`, or `exec.ps1` on Windows.
